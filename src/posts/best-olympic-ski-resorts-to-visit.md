There's something almost magical about skiing down a slope where Olympic champions once raced for gold. Standing at the top of a run where Lindsey Vonn pushed the limits of speed, or where Aksel Lund Svindal carved his way to glory, adds an emotional dimension that ordinary ski trips simply can't match. These mountains witnessed history -- and now it's your turn to ride them.

I've spent years visiting Olympic ski venues across the globe, from the glamorous Italian Dolomites to the futuristic slopes of South Korea. Not all Olympic venues are created equal when it comes to holiday skiing, though. Some have evolved into world-class resorts with incredible infrastructure, while others have faded or were never designed with casual visitors in mind.

Here's my definitive ranking of Olympic ski destinations you can visit today, from the absolute best to the ones you might want to skip.

## 1. Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (1956 & 2026 Olympics) -- The Undisputed Champion

**Overall Score: 10/10**

Cortina doesn't just top this list -- it dominates it. The Queen of the Dolomites has been a skiing icon since hosting the 1956 Winter Olympics, and the massive investment for the 2026 Games has elevated it to an entirely new level.

The skiing itself is extraordinary. With access to the Dolomiti Superski network (1,200 kilometers of interconnected slopes across 12 resorts), you could ski for weeks without repeating a run. The famous Tofana run, where the Olympic downhill takes place, is a thrilling descent that recreational skiers can tackle at their own pace. The views of the jagged Dolomite peaks -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- are simply the most beautiful mountain scenery in the skiing world.

But Cortina offers far more than slopes. The town itself is a gorgeous Italian village with world-class restaurants, boutique shopping, and that effortless Italian style that makes everything feel special. After a day on the mountain, sitting on a sunny terrace with an Aperol Spritz and a plate of fresh pasta, the pink-tinged Dolomite peaks glowing at sunset -- this is as good as skiing gets.

**Why it's #1:** Perfect combination of Olympic heritage, incredible skiing, stunning scenery, world-class food, and vibrant town atmosphere. The 2026 Olympics investment means brand-new infrastructure too.

**Day pass:** ~60 EUR | **Best time to visit:** January-March

## 2. Whistler Blackcomb, Canada (2010 Vancouver Olympics) -- The Complete Package

**Overall Score: 9.5/10**

When Vancouver hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, the alpine events took place at Whistler Blackcomb -- and the world discovered what Canadians already knew: this is one of the greatest ski resorts on Earth.

The numbers are staggering: over 8,100 acres of skiable terrain, more than 200 marked runs, and a vertical drop of 1,609 meters -- the longest in North America. The Peak 2 Peak Gondola, connecting Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, is an engineering marvel that gives you access to an impossibly vast playground.

Whistler Village itself is purpose-built but charming, with a pedestrian-only center packed with restaurants, bars, and shops. The apres ski scene is lively without being overwhelming, and the Canadian friendliness is genuine. The Dave Murray Downhill, the Olympic course, is open to the public and offers a legitimate taste of what the racers experienced.

**Why it's #2:** Enormous terrain variety, excellent village, reliable snow, and that unmistakable Canadian warmth. Only loses to Cortina because the Dolomites' natural beauty is truly one of a kind.

**Day pass:** ~180 CAD (~120 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** December-April

## 3. Chamonix, France (1924 Olympics) -- Where It All Began

**Overall Score: 9/10**

Chamonix hosted the very first Winter Olympics in 1924, and over a century later, it remains one of the most iconic mountain destinations on the planet. Sitting at the foot of Mont Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak, the setting is jaw-droppingly dramatic.

This isn't a resort for timid skiers. Chamonix is famed for its extreme off-piste terrain, including the legendary Vallee Blanche -- a 20-kilometer descent through glacial landscapes that's on every serious skier's bucket list. But there's excellent intermediate and even beginner terrain at nearby Le Tour and Les Houches.

The town of Chamonix is a genuine Alpine community, not a purpose-built resort, which gives it an authenticity that many modern ski destinations lack. The mountaineering culture runs deep -- this is where alpinism was born -- and the bars, restaurants, and shops reflect that heritage.

**Why it's #3:** Unbeatable history, dramatic scenery, incredible expert terrain, and genuine mountain town atmosphere. Dropped below Whistler because the skiing is less accessible for intermediate skiers.

**Day pass:** ~65 EUR | **Best time to visit:** January-March

## 4. Innsbruck, Austria (1964 & 1976 Olympics) -- The Alpine All-Rounder

**Overall Score: 8.5/10**

The only city to host the Winter Olympics twice, Innsbruck offers a unique proposition: a proper Austrian city with world-class culture, combined with nine ski resorts within easy reach. The Olympia SkiWorld Innsbruck pass gives you access to all of them.

The Patscherkofel, site of the Olympic downhill, is just 20 minutes from the city center by bus. The Nordkette, accessible directly from the city by cable car, offers steep, challenging terrain with views over the Inn Valley that are hard to beat. For families, the Axamer Lizum (another Olympic venue) provides gentle, well-groomed slopes.

Innsbruck itself is a gem -- Baroque architecture, cozy coffee houses, excellent museums, and a food scene that blends traditional Tyrolean cuisine with modern innovation. The combination of city culture and Alpine skiing is unmatched.

**Why it's #4:** Unique city-plus-skiing combination, excellent variety of terrain, rich culture, and genuine Austrian charm. Multiple Olympic venues add historical depth.

**Day pass:** ~55 EUR (Olympia SkiWorld pass) | **Best time to visit:** December-March

## 5. Lillehammer, Norway (1994 Olympics) -- The Feel-Good Favorite

**Overall Score: 8/10**

The 1994 Lillehammer Olympics are widely considered the greatest Winter Games ever held, and visiting the venues today, you can feel why. The Norwegian approach -- sustainable, human-scaled, deeply connected to the landscape -- created something special that endures.

Hafjell, the main alpine venue, offers 33 kilometers of slopes with excellent grooming and a family-friendly atmosphere. The terrain is varied enough to keep intermediates happy for a long weekend, though experts might want more. Kvitfjell, the downhill venue 45 minutes away, offers steeper, more challenging runs.

Lillehammer town is charming in a understated Nordic way -- wooden buildings, cozy cafes, and a genuine local community. The Olympic Museum is one of the best sports museums in the world and worth a visit even for non-skiing travelers.

**Why it's #5:** Wonderfully authentic atmosphere, excellent family skiing, beautiful Nordic scenery, and the legacy of the "best Olympics ever." Loses points for limited expert terrain and high Scandinavian prices.

**Day pass:** ~490 NOK (~45 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** January-April

## 6. Salt Lake City / Park City, USA (2002 Olympics) -- The American Dream

**Overall Score: 7.5/10**

The 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics delivered alpine events at Snowbasin and Deer Valley, both within easy reach of Park City -- America's most famous ski town. The "Greatest Snow on Earth" marketing isn't just hype; Utah's dry, light powder is genuinely exceptional.

Park City Mountain Resort is now the largest ski area in the United States after merging with Canyons. The terrain is vast and varied, and the historic Main Street, lined with restaurants and galleries, provides excellent apres ski. Deer Valley, the Olympic slalom venue, is one of America's most luxurious resorts, limiting daily skier numbers for an uncrowded experience.

**Why it's #6:** Incredible snow quality, massive terrain, great town atmosphere. Loses points for the long-haul flight from Europe and expensive lift tickets.

**Day pass:** ~220 USD (~200 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** January-March

## 7. Turin / Sestriere, Italy (2006 Olympics) -- The Underrated Italian

**Overall Score: 7/10**

The 2006 Turin Olympics brought the alpine events to Sestriere and the Milky Way (Via Lattea) ski area -- a massive 400-kilometer network that stretches across the Italian-French border. Despite the Olympic pedigree, Sestriere remains surprisingly under-the-radar for international visitors.

The skiing is excellent, particularly for intermediates, with long, flowing runs through beautiful Piedmont scenery. The Olympic downhill course at Sestriere is accessible to confident intermediate skiers and offers a genuine thrill. Prices are significantly lower than in the Dolomites or French mega-resorts.

**Why it's #7:** Great value, extensive terrain, authentic Italian atmosphere without the Cortina price tag. Loses points for a less charming resort village compared to top-ranked destinations.

**Day pass:** ~42 EUR | **Best time to visit:** January-March

## 8. Albertville / Val d'Isere, France (1992 Olympics) -- The Party Meets the Podium

**Overall Score: 7/10**

The 1992 Albertville Olympics spread events across the Savoie region, with the alpine skiing held at Val d'Isere and its neighbor Tignes. Today, the Espace Killy area (named after French skiing legend Jean-Claude Killy) offers 300 kilometers of slopes and some of the best apres ski in Europe.

Val d'Isere is famous for La Face de Bellevarde, the Olympic downhill course -- a brutal, steep descent that will test even expert skiers. The resort's high altitude (1,850-3,450m) ensures reliable snow throughout the season. And the apres ski? La Folie Douce alone makes this worth the visit.

**Why it's #8:** Excellent skiing, legendary apres ski, reliable snow. Ranked here rather than higher because the resort village feels more functional than charming.

**Day pass:** ~68 EUR | **Best time to visit:** December-April

## 9. Nagano / Hakuba, Japan (1998 Olympics) -- The Cultural Curveball

**Overall Score: 6.5/10**

The 1998 Nagano Olympics introduced the world to Japanese skiing, and Hakuba Valley -- the main alpine venue -- remains one of the most unique ski destinations on Earth. The combination of incredible Japanese powder (up to 11 meters of annual snowfall), hot spring onsen bathing, and extraordinary food culture creates an experience unlike anything in Europe or North America.

The skiing itself is good but not great by Olympic standards -- the terrain is relatively limited compared to mega-resorts, and the lift systems can feel dated. But nobody comes to Japan just for the slopes. It's the complete cultural experience -- soaking in an outdoor onsen while snow falls around you, eating the world's best ramen after a powder day -- that makes Hakuba special.

**Why it's #9:** Unforgettable cultural experience and legendary powder. Loses points for limited terrain variety, aging infrastructure, and the distance from Europe.

**Day pass:** ~5,500 JPY (~35 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** January-February

## 10. Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina (1984 Olympics) -- The Emotional Journey

**Overall Score: 6/10**

Sarajevo's 1984 Winter Olympics are remembered as a joyful celebration of sport in a diverse, cosmopolitan city. A decade later, the same mountains became frontlines in a devastating war. Today, visiting the Olympic venues is a profoundly moving experience -- the bobsled track on Mount Trebevic, covered in bullet holes and graffiti art, is one of the most powerful sporting ruins in the world.

The skiing at Jahorina (women's alpine) and Bjelasnica (men's alpine) is surprisingly good. Modern lifts have replaced the war-damaged originals, the terrain is varied and fun, and lift tickets cost a fraction of Alpine prices. Sarajevo itself is fascinating -- a cultural crossroads of Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and modern influences.

**Why it's #10:** Incredible value, moving history, and improving infrastructure. Loses points for limited terrain compared to top destinations and still-developing tourist services.

**Day pass:** ~35 BAM (~18 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** January-March

## 11. PyeongChang, South Korea (2018 Olympics) -- The Modern Marvel

**Overall Score: 5.5/10**

PyeongChang's 2018 Olympics produced some extraordinary sporting moments, but as a ski holiday destination, it's a mixed bag. The Yongpyong and Jeongseon Alpine Centre venues offer decent skiing with ultra-modern facilities, but the terrain is limited and the natural snowfall inconsistent.

What does work is the efficiency -- South Korean infrastructure is world-class, and getting from Seoul to the slopes by KTX bullet train takes just 90 minutes. The food is phenomenal (Korean BBQ after skiing is a revelation), and the cultural experience is fascinating for first-time visitors.

**Why it's #11:** Great infrastructure and unique cultural experience. But the skiing itself can't compete with European or North American Olympic venues.

**Day pass:** ~79,000 KRW (~55 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** January-February

## 12. Beijing / Yanqing, China (2022 Olympics) -- The Engineered Experience

**Overall Score: 4.5/10**

The 2022 Beijing Olympics were controversial for many reasons, and the alpine skiing venue at Yanqing reflects the complexity. The National Alpine Ski Center is a technical marvel -- carved into a mountain with state-of-the-art snowmaking covering every meter of the courses. The facilities are brand new and impressive.

But the skiing experience feels engineered rather than natural. Almost all the snow is artificial, the surrounding landscape lacks the charm of Alpine villages, and the resort area has a somewhat clinical feel. For skiing enthusiasts, it's an interesting curiosity but not a destination you'd choose over European or North American alternatives.

**Why it's #12:** Impressive facilities but limited natural appeal. Visiting feels more like touring infrastructure than enjoying mountain culture.

**Day pass:** ~600 CNY (~75 EUR) | **Best time to visit:** December-February

## 13. Sochi / Rosa Khutor, Russia (2014 Olympics) -- The Controversial One

**Overall Score: 4/10 (currently not recommended)**

Rosa Khutor, built from scratch for the 2014 Sochi Olympics, is actually an impressive ski resort with modern infrastructure, 102 kilometers of slopes, and a vertical drop of 1,745 meters. Under normal circumstances, it would rank significantly higher on this list.

However, current geopolitical realities mean Rosa Khutor is effectively inaccessible for most international visitors. Sanctions, flight restrictions, and safety concerns make it impractical to recommend. If circumstances change in the future, it could climb this ranking substantially.

**Why it's #13:** Good skiing on paper, but currently not a viable destination for most international travelers.

## Planning Your Olympic Ski Pilgrimage

The beauty of Olympic ski destinations is that they span every continent with winter sports, every budget level, and every skill level. Whether you're chasing Cortina's Dolomite sunsets or Sarajevo's powerful history, skiing where the world's best once competed adds an emotional charge to every run.

My advice? Start with the destination that excites you most, not the one ranked highest. If Japanese culture fascinates you, Hakuba will deliver more joy than Cortina despite its lower ranking. If you're a history buff, Sarajevo or Chamonix will move you in ways that a newer resort never could.

The Olympic flame may have left these mountains, but the magic they created lives on in every turn.
